    "    - Website theming: The iniital intention is a notebook-esque website, which is achieved by the current design to a very small extent, but will need improvements\n",
    "    - Colors: I focused on warm brown colors, but after trying to adjust the color scheme, the current color setup (by this I mean color assignments) does not seem to be flexible\n",
    "    - Fonts: I was unaware of the rem and em distinction and their relationship to root font, so adjustments there will be inevitable"
