                <h2>Tutorial Purgatory</h2>
                <p>Date Posted: 08-26-2025</p> <br>
                <p>Tutorial Purgatory is (probably) eternal, but that's not a bad thing. We developers always learn new things, 
                    and many of these new things are from the code and learnings of other developers. It is always 
                    fascinating to learn a standard that I was not aware of back then, and because it is fascinating, 
                    it will stick in my head when I try to code something where that standard is incorporated in.</p>

                <p>However, not all tutorials and sample code are created equal, and not all tutorials follow standards. 
                    The negative aspect of tutorial purgatory is when we're not learning a maintainable way of creating a 
                    project. If a tutorial has confusing use of triple equals and double equals (in the case of Javascript), 
                    it can be quite difficult for the developer to debug the tutorial code when they run into problems. 
                    And, when a beginner developer feels stuck they might also overly rely on the tutorial's code 
                    implementation, which can limit their own capabilities when moving on to making something of their own.</p>
                <p>It is likely the case that following good tutorials is a <em>must</em> if one decides to learn a 
                    certain technology through a roadmap filled with tutorial videos. Or, it may also be better 
                    if one learns a technology through other means besides following a video tutorial. Developers 
                    with enough familiarity with general programmling language concepts can try dissecting code 
                    from repositories, learning what a function does, or how a certain aspect of a project is 
                    implemented. Maybe when one wants to make a portfolio site, it is better to look for other 
                    portfolio sites, or even portfolio repositories, to see what contents are made and how they are 
                    implemented. This kind of learning is still 'following something', where the repositories are 
                    probably tutorial repositories too. But exposing oneself to so much code on their own pace 
                    instead of in a video's pace (which can be slow), may make the whole learning journey more fascinating and varied.</p>
                <p>And when it is fascinating, we developers can get obssessed. And when we get obssessed over something, 
                    we enter the zone, learning so much in the process. Now, if only it was easy to find good tutorials and repositories to learn from...</p>
