                <h2>AI-Driven Pipeline Development</h2>
                <p>Date Posted: 08-26-2025</p> <br>
                <p>I have always been fascinated with local usage of LLMs, integrating local models to tool pipelines that 
                    can help assist the learning process for beginners or help assist in other development processes. 
                    While it is unfortunate that local models are very resource hungry, it is still quite interesting to come up 
                    with ways to utilize them as automation or assistance tools.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- <section class="picture-section">

            <section class="body-section">
                <p>Here is a very simplified prototype pipeline of my team's thesis project, Next Gen QA, utilizing 
                    large language models, prompt engineering, and scraping technologies to automate the creation of 
                    website test cases (or functional test cases). </p>
                <p>It all starts with an assumption of: "What does an LLM need to know before it infers that it will 
                    create a test case?". Surely it is not only a prompt that says "Create a test case", as an LLM 
                    may need more 'context' for that. That is where scraping technologies got included in the mix, 
                    to scrape website elements that will serve as context on what test cases to generate. 
                    It can be a straightforward pipeline on paper, but it opens the possibilities on other 
                    similar ideas or concepts. Such as automating project idea flow, or scaffold generation.</p>
                <p>If more of us can use Local LLMs with more optimized/resource friendly algorithms, 
                    which is probably too ideal, I find myself very excited to dabble with some assitive 
                    software tool ideas. But for now, nope, as it is too resource demanding for my machine in 
                    particular for now. Strong local AI requires strong computing power.</p>
