                <h2>Welcome to My Website!</h2>
                <p>Date Posted: 08-26-2025</p> <br>
                <p>Welcome to my personal website, where I will essentially showcase my hobby projects, 
                    profession-related works, dev logs, and many other things. This is currently the 
                    first iteration of the site, and it is published on Github Pages. As I build up my 
                    works and logs, I will eventually work on the next iteration of the site, which may or 
                    may not stay in Github Pages. I expect this site to evolve not just in its layout, 
                    but also in its content. It is all about exploration and studying in the end and 
                    I'm all for it!</p>
            </section>

            <section class="body-section">
                <p>While I did place most of the important information at the home and about pages, 
                    there are some things that I would like to write here. Besides being a developer, 
                    I like playing games (that tends to be retro-style ones) a lot, and I also like music 
                    and pixel art. I aspire to be able to do gamedev-related hobbies (e.g. writing, music, graphics, coding) 
                    on the side as I progress in my main career of software development. I am also mostly a backend-focused 
                    developer, as I used to not really like dealing with CSS and I have more of a preference of working 
                    with databases or logic aspects of a software or program. Mostly because I find those more interesting</p>
                <p>I built this website using vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript, to prove to myself that I can start 
                    designing and implementing basic websites, and by extension, user interfaces, meaning that I can 
                    start iterating or improving on it by studying references, portfolios of other developers, 
                    and listing down things that I would like to add to my site. Building up from a very basic 
                    foundation (vanilla css, js, html) also feels more comfortable too since as the developer, 
                    I feel that I have more control this way. But of course, once my momentum with node.js begins I'll 
                    build a static site generator or use libraries, just to make a potentially more maintaible site.</p>
