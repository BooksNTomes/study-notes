                <h2>On Random Numbers</h2>
                <p>Date Posted: 08-26-2025</p> <br>
                <p>Creating random number generators tends to be my go-to hello world program when trying to 
                    learn something new in terms of frameworks or languages, such as when I made an FFV 
                    random jobpicker at android studio during senior highschool, or when I made a random 
                    number generator at Laravel as my initial warmup before the OJT project began. It wont be my permanent 
                    go-to, but it tends to be my go-to, even now in learning react and node.js. Maybe I'll warmup in C# 
                    too by making a random number generator...</p>

            <section class="body-section">
                <p>It's because random numbers are quite interesting, they allow randomized behavior in programs, and 
                    especially games. Sure it is not <em>true</em> random, but it is random <em>enough</em> to make things varied in 
                    terms of behavior. But in these sorts of generators, I can see that it can be decomposed to the 
                    following elements: the <em>List</em> containing all of the elements to be picked, the actual <em>Algorithm</em> 
                    responsible for picking the elements, and a <em>Configuration</em> that limits either the list scope or 
                    the algorithm's scope of picking.</p>
                <p>A good example would be the classic random number generator of integers. 
                    The List is the integers themselves, the Algorithm is whatever algorithm is used, 
                    and an example of a Configuration is a min value of 0 and a max value of 100, so that 
                    the algorithm is restricted to picking only from 0 to 100. In a random name generator, 
                    given that there is a predefined name list, a configuration would be what names are 
                    included or excluded to the list. This small realization intrigued me.</p>
                <p>With that in mind, I am currently developing a random number generator site 
                    using react and node.js, and I want to add a twist. But I want to save that 
                    for when I actually implement it right. There's a lot to learn from implementing an API,
                    a database, and a frontend with the help of tailwind css. As someone whose more currently comfortable with
                    vanilla HTML and CSS, using something different like react, and having proper backend with node.js is going
                    to be an interesting ride.</p>
